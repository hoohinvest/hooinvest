## 🚀 Testing & Verification

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Visit http://localhost:3001 to see new homepage
- [ ] Click "I'm a Business – Raise Capital" CTA → redirects to /business
- [ ] Click "I'm an Investor – Explore Deals" CTA → redirects to /investors
- [ ] Fill out Business form and submit → check Google Sheet for new row with RecordType=BUSINESS

### Google Sheets Verification
1. Open the Google Sheet connected to `https://sheetdb.io/api/v1/czm7s7mm0opth`

   - `RecordType` column = "BUSINESS" or "INVESTOR"
   - `SubmittedAt` column = ISO timestamp
   - `SourcePath` column = form source
   - All form fields populated in respective columns

### Filter Testing
In Google Sheets, you should be able to:
- Filter by `RecordType` to see only Business or Investor submissions
- Filter by `SourcePath` to see which page generated the lead
- Filter by `Status` to manage lead workflow
- Filter by `SubmittedAt` date range
